I'm currently a research assistant at IIIT-Hyderabad's CVIT lab, working under Dr Vineet Gandhi on weakly supervised learning.
Before this, I had a wonderful time at Cube26 reserach lab as a research engineer, working on machine learning problems in vision, text and speech with a bunch of very smart folks.

### About this blog

If it wasn't for all the lateral learning I got from research, this blog would have been purely about machine learning. But due to the surprising interconnectedness of research and a number of topics like technology, startups, social implications of machine learning and life in general, this blog will probably not be confined to purely technical posts. Ping me if you have something interesting to talk about!
