I am an incoming graduate student at the Robotics Institute at CMU. Earlier, I spent a wonderful year as a research assistant at IIIT-Hyderabad's CVIT lab, working under Dr Vineet Gandhi on self supervised learning in vision and langauge, perception in autonomous vehicles and realtime video stabilization. Prior to this, I was a research engineer at Cube26 lab (acquired by Paytm), working on machine learning problems in vision, text and speech with a bunch of very interesting folks. Here's my complete [**resume**](../cv.pdf).

### About this blog

If it wasn't for all the lateral learning there was to get from research, this blog would have been purely about machine learning. But due to the interconnectedness of research and a number of topics like technology, startups, social implications of machine learning and research and life in general, this blog will probably not be confined to purely technical posts. Ping me if you have something interesting to talk about!
