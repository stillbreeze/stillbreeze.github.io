I currently work on machine learning research and products for computational cancer pathology at [PathAI](https://www.pathai.com/). Before this, I was a graduate student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Professor Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/) on 3D spatial reasoning using multimodal generative models, and with [Professor Michael Kaess](http://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~kaess/) and the team from Amazon Lab126 on online camera calibration for visual SLAM. Earlier, I spent a wonderful year as a research assistant at IIIT-Hyderabad's [CVIT lab](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), working with [Professor Vineet Gandhi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/) on self-supervised learning in vision and langauge and perception in autonomous vehicles. Here's my [**LinkedIn profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linkedinashar).


### Professional mission

I’m interested in building products which affect people positively and improve the status quo. I’m particularly excited by machine learning research and its role in solving technical problems which have real world impact.

Some things I deeply value
1. Ambitious problems
2. Technology that changes how society operates
3. Interesting, smart, and authentic people

### About this blog

If it wasn't for all the lateral learning there was to get from research, this blog would have been purely about machine learning. But due to the interconnectedness of research and a number of topics like technology, startups, social implications of machine learning, research, and life in general, this blog will probably not be confined to purely technical posts. Ping me if you have something interesting to talk about!
