I currently work on machine learning based methods for computational pathology at [PathAI](https://www.pathai.com/). Before this, I was a masters student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Professor Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/) on 3D spatial reasoning using generative models, and with [Professor Michael Kaess](http://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~kaess/) and the team from Amazon Lab126 on online camera calibration for visual SLAM. Earlier, I spent a wonderful year as a research assistant at IIIT-Hyderabad's [CVIT lab](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), working with [Professor Vineet Gandhi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/) on self supervised learning in vision and langauge, perception in autonomous vehicles and realtime video stabilization. Here's my complete [**resume**](../cv.pdf).

### About this blog

If it wasn't for all the lateral learning there was to get from research, this blog would have been purely about machine learning. But due to the interconnectedness of research and a number of topics like technology, startups, social implications of machine learning and research and life in general, this blog will probably not be confined to purely technical posts. Ping me if you have something interesting to talk about!
