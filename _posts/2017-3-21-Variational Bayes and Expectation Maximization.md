title: Variational Bayes and Expectation Maximization
---

Few days ago, when reading about variational autoencoders, I came to know that variational bayes was in fact a generalization of the popular algorithm, Expectation Maximization(EM). This post offers an explanation of Variational Inference and how it relates to the EM algorithm.
