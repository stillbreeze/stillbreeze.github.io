title: Variational Bayes and Expectation Maximization
---

Few days ago, when reading about variational autoencoders, I came to know that variational bayes was in fact a generalization of the popular algorithm, Expectation Maximization(EM). After hours of equation scribbling and searching on the internet, I wasn't satisfied with what I had gotten, namely this StackExchange answer [here](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/105661/relation-between-variational-bayes-and-em) and a few of tutorials which didn't explicitly show how they were related. So, after going through a couple of lectures and course notes, the links of which are given in the footnotes, this post aims to provide a simple understanding of the relation between these two extremely useful concepts.
